# Workspace Definition

The Workspace defines the ephemeral "state" of the Parts/OCC entities being operated on.
(This is not to be confused with the `WorkUnit` tree). The Workspace currently does not have
the same serialization/deserialization requirement that the `WorkUnit` tree does: it may
be discarded and regenerated at any time.

Also included in the `Workspace` are the following tracked entities:

- Current User Selection (TopoDS_Shape entities)
- Current `Parts`.
- Workplanes (generated by workplane commands), which may be used as the basis for sketching.
